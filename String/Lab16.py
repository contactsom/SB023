After completing my course, I landed a cybersecurity project at work and soon secured a 
SOC Analyst role, leveraging skills like vulnerability analysis and penetration testing.
 The course also helped me transition to a new role at BetaNXT with a salary increase of 55%.
  Hands-on projects and comprehensive content were key to this career switch.
